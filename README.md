# Portfolio

## Description

Thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio! I am a recent graduate of the UCLA Extension Coding Bootcamp and this portfolio contains several of my projects from the course as well as a few personal projects. Currently, my portfolio is undergoing a redesign therefore it may look incomplete. This is only temporary while I choose which of my projects to highlight. Some of the porjects in my portfolio are Group Projects from class and some will be my own personal projects that I designed myself. 

 
Please feel free to contact me with any questions or suggestions. Your feedback would be greatly appreciated as this project is still under construction!

## Development 

Orignally, I designed an HTML portfolio as part of my first week of my coding bootcamp. I had zero prior coding or development expereince prior to the bootcamp. Now that I have passed the course and gained a new passion, I am revisiting this project so that it may more accurately reflect my professional skills.
