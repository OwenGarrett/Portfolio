# Portfolio

## Description

Thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio! I am a recent graduate of the UCLA Extension Coding Bootcamp and this portfolio contains several of my projects from the course as well as a few personal projects. Currently, my portfolio is undergoing a redesign therefore it may look incomplete. This is only temporary while I choose which of my projects to highlight. Some of the porjects in my portfolio are Group Projects from class and some will be my own personal projects that I designed myself. 

 This portfolio was designed using HTML5; CSS; and VS Code. 

 Please feel free to contact me with any questions or suggestions. Your feedback would be greatly appreciated!

## How to use application

You may access Patron as a deployed application on Heroku. New users may sign up and create a profile. Once the user has made a profile, they have the ability to search the Metropolitan Museum of Art's entire catalogue of artifacts and artwork and create their own gallery by adding individual images to their profile gallery. User's are able delete images from their personal galleries as well as leave comments underneath each image as long as they are logged in.
